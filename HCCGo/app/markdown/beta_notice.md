### 0.4.0 Beta

A redesign of the app!  It includes a new side bar which should help in navigation.

Also changes:

* View text files (Windows & Mac).
* New tutorials on the tutorials page.
* Monitor externally submitted jobs from within the app.

### 0.3.0 Beta

So many things!

* View the output and error of a job.
* Receive automatic updates when new releases are available.
* Include a tutorials page to install HCC tutorials.
